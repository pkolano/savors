Savors Installation and Configuration
=====================================

Savors has been successfully tested on Linux, OSX, Windows under Cygwin
and Android under Debian fakeroot.


1. Prerequisites

    1.1. Required

        o Perl >= 5.7.3 and non-standard modules (with their prerequisites):
            o GD
            o Imager
            o IO::Pty
            o Tk

    1.2. Required for optional capabilities

        The bulk of Savors can run without these items, but they are
        required for full functionality.

        1.2.1. Required for geolocation functions

            These functions include ipcity(), ipcountry(),
            ipcountry2(), iplat(), iplong(), ipstate(), and ipzip()

            o IP2Location lite DB11 binary database (https://lite.ip2location.com/database/ip-country-region-city-latitude-longitude-zipcode-timezone)

        1.2.2. Required for cloud view

            o Python 2.x and non-standard modules (with their prerequisites):
                o cython >= 0.16
                o numpy
                o PIL/pillow

        1.2.3. Required for graph view types {circo,dot,fdp,neato,sfdp,twopi}

            o Graphviz (http://graphviz.org)

        1.2.4. Required for "sequence" graph view type

            o Mscgen (http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen)


2. Preparation

    2.1. $PATH

        The dot and mscgen executables of Graphviz and Mscgen,
        respectively, must be available during configuration/execution
        either through the standard system paths or an appropriate value
        of $PATH.

    2.2. $PERLLIB

        The Perl module prerequisites must be available during
        configuration/execution either through the standard Perl
        module directories or an appropriate value of $PERLLIB.

    2.3. $PYTHONPATH

        The Python module prerequisites must be available during
        configuration/execution either through the standard Python
        module directories or an appropriate value of $PYTHONPATH.

    2.4. IP2Location lite DB11 binary database

        The IP2Location lite DB11 database must be uncompressed from zip
        format after download and the file "IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB11.BIN"
        placed in an appropriate directory (e.g. /usr/share/IP2Location)


3. Installation

    Installation uses the standard configure/make process.  The
    configure command can be given an installation prefix via --prefix
    (defaults to /usr/local), a perl installation prefix via --plprefix
    (defaults to /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_lib/$PERLVER), and the full
    path to the uncompressed GeoLiteCity database (geolocation functions
    unusable if not given).  For example, the following would install
    Savors into /usr using the IP2Location DB11 database in
    /usr/share/IP2Location:

        ./configure --prefix=/usr --geodb=/usr/share/IP2Location/IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB11.BIN
        make
        make install


4. Configuration and Usage

    See individual man page entries for savorsrc(5) and savors(1).
